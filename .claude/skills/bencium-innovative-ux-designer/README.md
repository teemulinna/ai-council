# Innovative UX Designer Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## Philosophy

**Bold creativity meets production rigor.** This skill generates unique, memorable interfaces while maintaining accessibility and responsive patterns. No "AI slop" - every design should feel intentionally crafted.

## Key Principles

### 1. Design Thinking Protocol
Ask questions first to understand context, then **commit boldly** to an aesthetic direction.

### 2. Anti-Generic Aesthetics
**Avoid:** Inter, Roboto, Space Grotesk, SaaS blue (#3B82F6), glass morphism, Apple mimicry

**Embrace:** Characterful typography, unexpected color combinations, intentional visual hierarchy

### 3. Bold Visual Expression
Shadows and gradients are creative tools when used intentionally. The constraint is against effects that serve no purpose or mimic platforms.

### 4. Accessibility Baseline
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance enables creativity - it's a foundation, not a limitation.

## Tone Options

Pick an extreme to commit to:
- **Brutally minimal** - stripped to essence, bold typography
- **Maximalist chaos** - layered, dense, controlled disorder
- **Retro-futuristic** - vintage meets sci-fi
- **Organic/natural** - earth tones, flowing shapes
- **Editorial/magazine** - grid-based, typographic
- **Brutalist/raw** - exposed structure, monospace
