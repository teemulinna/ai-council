## MCP Tool Discovery System

The Agentic QE Fleet uses **lazy-loaded MCP tools** to reduce initial context by 87%.

### Tool Discovery

```javascript
// Discover available tool domains
mcp__agentic_qe__tools_discover()
// Returns: security, coverage, test-generation, test-execution, quality-gates,
//          fleet-management, memory, learning, patterns, reporting

// Load specific domain tools
mcp__agentic_qe__tools_load_domain({ domain: "security" })
mcp__agentic_qe__tools_load_domain({ domain: "coverage" })
```

### Automatic Loading

Tools are **auto-loaded based on keywords** when agents work:
- "security", "vulnerability" → loads security tools
- "coverage", "gaps" → loads coverage tools
- "generate", "create tests" → loads test-generation tools
- "execute", "run tests" → loads test-execution tools

### Benefits

- **87% context reduction** (from 15,000 to 2,000 tokens initially)
- **Faster agent spawning** with minimal overhead
- **On-demand loading** only when tools are needed

## Agent Coordination

All agents coordinate through the **`aqe/*` memory namespace**:

- `aqe/test-plan/*` - Test planning and requirements
- `aqe/coverage/*` - Coverage analysis and gaps
- `aqe/quality/*` - Quality metrics and gates
- `aqe/performance/*` - Performance test results
- `aqe/security/*` - Security scan findings
- `aqe/swarm/coordination` - Cross-agent coordination

## Parallel Agent Execution

Execute multiple agents concurrently for maximum efficiency:

```javascript
// Execute multiple agents in parallel
Task("Test Generation", "Generate unit tests", "qe-test-generator")
Task("Coverage Analysis", "Analyze current coverage", "qe-coverage-analyzer")
Task("Security Scan", "Run security checks", "qe-security-scanner")
Task("Performance Test", "Load test critical paths", "qe-performance-tester")
```
